# Representing Rational Numbers

Ora provides native support for rational numbers. In Ora, an integer divided by an integer is interpreted as a rational number. To perform real division, at least one of the operands must be a float. For example, writing the expression

$$
	\texttt{1/2}
$$

is interpreted as the rational number ${1/2.}$ Writing:

$$
	\texttt{1.0/2.0}
$$

is reduced to the floating point value ${0.5.}$ This article presents and explains the algorithms Ora uses for rational number arithmetic.

## The Fraction Class
Simple rational numbers are represented in Ora with the `Fraction` class. The two key properties of `Fraction` objects (instances of the `Fraction` class) are `_numerator` and `_denominator`. These two properties follow from the common definition of a rational number:

<blockquote>

__*definition*__. A rational number is a number of the form ${a/b,}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers, with ${b \neq 0.}$

</blockquote>

## Simplest Form
Writing the `Fraction` class, the first thing we want to implement are _comparison relations_. In particular, we want to be able to tell whether two rational numbers are equal. Implementing equality first makes for easier test writing.  

Fractions have a bit of a funny property. Clearly, ${1/2 = 1/2.}$ But, as any elementary school student would remind us, these statements are also true: ${1/2 = 2/4,}$ ${2/4 = 4/8,}$ ${4/8 = 8/16,}$ etc. Lexically, they aren't equal, but they certainly are numerically: Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ buy a pie. They divide it into ${8}$ pieces. ${A}$ shall have ${4,}$ and ${B}$ shall have ${4.}$ Thus, ${A}$ takes ${4/8}$ and ${B}$ takes ${4/8.}$ This is the same thing as saying that ${A}$ takes half the pie (${1/2}$) and ${B}$ takes half the pie (${1/2}$).

Thus, to implement equality, we must first implement a way of reducing any given fraction to _simplest form_. We define _simplest form_ as follows:

<blockquote>

__*definition*__. A fraction ${a/b}$ is in simplest form when the numerator and the denominator have no common factors other than one.

</blockquote>

We can reduce a fraction ${a/b}$ to satisfy this definition by first finding the greatest common factor of the two integers ${a}$ and ${b.}$ We can do so with _Euclid's algorithm_, implemented via recursion:

<Procedure>

> __*algorithm*__. Recursive GCF

Returns the greatest common factor of two integers ${a}$ and ${b.}$ 

- __input__
  - ${a:}$ an integer.
  - ${b:}$ an integer. 
- __output__
  - an integer.

1. __function__ GCF `(`${a,}$ ${b}$`)`:
   1. __if__ `(` ${b = 0}$ `)`: 
      1. __return__ ${a}$
   2. __else__:
      1. __return__ GCF`(`${b,}$ ${a ~ \text{rem} ~ b}$`)`

</Procedure>

This is an elegant algorithm. But, we risk entering a stack overflow with large enough integers. A safer implementation would use iteration:

<Procedure>

> __*algorithm*__. Iterative GCF.

- __input__
  - ${a:}$ an integer.
  - ${b:}$ an integer. 
- __output__
  - an integer.

1. __function__ GCF(${a,}$ ${b}$):
   1. ${t \leftarrow 0}$
   2. __while__ ${b \neq 0}$:
      1. ${t \leftarrow b}$
      2. ${b \leftarrow a ~ \text{rem} ~ b}$
      3. ${a \leftarrow t}$
   3. __return__ ${a}$
</Procedure>

The iterative approach, while not as elegant, gets the job done safely.
